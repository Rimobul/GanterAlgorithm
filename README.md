Ganter Next Closure Algorithm

This is my C# implementation of Bernhard Ganter's Next Closure algorithm for creating lattice from a formal concept. The algorithm is based on the presentation from Mr. Ganter himself (http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~ganter/psfiles/FingerExercises.pdf).

The subsequent transition reduction is based on my own algorithm (however, this algorithm may already exist - I have not researched it).
The code is not optimized so far.
